# Project  Backend + SQL - Tinder for Personal Skills

## Description
API that allows users to search for people based on their skills, with the aim of hiring them.

**Example scenario:**

Pedrito Sola is introverted but highly skilled in public speaking. He wants to earn some money by offering his services, so he creates an account on **'Tinder for Skills'**, where he advertises his skills at a rate of $30 per hour.

Meanwhile, **Rappi**, a company looking for someone with strong public speaking skills to record commercials, searches for talent on the **'Tinder for Skills'** platform and finds Pedrito Sola.

They contact Pedrito and agree on 6 hours of work to record the commercial. Rappi needs to receive a quote for Pedrito’s services.

**'Tinder for Skills'** requests an advance payment from Rappi so that Pedrito Sola can show up at the agreed-upon location to start working. Once the advance is paid, Pedrito Sola is notified of the date, time, and place of the work.

After the commercial is completed, both Pedrito Sola and Rappi confirm the service in the app. Rappi then completes the remaining payment and rates Pedrito Sola’s service.

## Project Technical Requirements:
- **Database Design**: Use tools like Draw.io, Miro, etc.
- **Migrations**: Implement database migrations.
- **MVC**: Follow the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.
